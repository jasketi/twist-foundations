## 🔍 Purpose

This repository provides supporting structures for the mathematical and ontological foundations of the twist-topological model described in the above paper. It includes:

- Symbolic representations of the σ-cycle (return structure, eigenvalue condition)
- Topological constructions (non-orientable manifolds, twist bundles)
- Diagrams illustrating the Klein bottle, fixed-point dynamics, and triadic base structure
- Optional: LaTeX sources, bib entries, or supporting Mathematica notebooks

---

## 📂 Contents

- `CODEBOOK.md` – technical overview of all included concepts and mappings
- `figures/` – visual representations: σ-cycle, Klein bottle, functor graphs
- `logic/` – symbolic and categorical structures (optional scripts)
- `tex/` – (optional) LaTeX and bib sources for the paper

## 📚 Core Concepts

- **Triadic base manifold**: Möbius × S¹ × Triade
- **Fixed-point logic**: Knaster-Tarski theorem applied to explanatory predicate lattices
- **Mod-2 index**: derived from Stiefel-Whitney classes on the 4-Klein bottle
- **Return structure**: σ(t + 2π) = σ(t) only after n = 137 steps → interpretation of α_em as first eigenfrequency
